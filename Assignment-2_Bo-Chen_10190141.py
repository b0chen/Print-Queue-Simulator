CISC 121 Assignment #2: Print Queue Simulator
July 24, 2017

This is a Python version 3.6 of the Print Queue Simulator.
This program simulates a printing queue. It has four major functions:
Job Submit, Print, Queue Contents, and Remove. 
I also reads in commands from online textfiles.
Detailed explination can be found here: https://goo.gl/Pwa1gw
"""
import urllib.request

"""
The commands() function follows the commands from the printsim.txt on the
CS.QUEENSU.CA webpage. It takes commands and runs specific fuctions based
on the action given.
